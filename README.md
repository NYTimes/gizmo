This toolkit provides packages to put together server and pubsub daemons with the following features:

* Standardized configuration and logging
* Health check endpoints with configurable strategies
* Configuration for managing pprof endpoints and log levels
* Structured logging containing basic request information
* Useful metrics for endpoints
* Graceful shutdowns
* Basic interfaces to define expectations and vocabulary

### Packages

#### [`server`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/server)

This package is the bulk of the toolkit and relies on `server.Config` to manage `Server` implementations.

It offers 2 server implementations:

1. [`SimpleServer`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/server#SimpleServer), which is capable of handling basic HTTP and JSON requests via 5 of the available `Service` implementations: `SimpleService`, `JSONService`, `ContextService`, `MixedService` and a `MixedContextService`.

2. [`RPCServer`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/server#RPCServer), which is capable of serving a gRPC server on one port and JSON endpoints on another. This kind of server can only handle the `RPCService` implementation.

#### [`config`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/config)

The `config` package contains a handful of useful functions to load to configuration structs from JSON files, JSON blobs in Consul k/v, or environment variables.

* There are also many structs for common configuration options and credentials of different Cloud Services and Databases.
* The package also has a generic `Config` type in the `config/combined` subpackage that contains all of the above types. It's meant to be a 'catch all' convenience struct that many applications should be able to use.

#### [`pubsub`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/pubsub)

The `pubsub` package contains two (`publisher` and `subscriber`) generic interfaces for publishing data to queues as well as subscribing and consuming data from those queues.

#### [`pubsub/pubsubtest`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/pubsub/pubsubtest)

This package contains test implementations of the `pubsub.Publisher`, `pubsub.MultiPublisher`, and `pubsub.Subscriber` interfaces that will allow developers to easily mock out and test their `pubsub` implementations.

#### [`web`](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/web)

This package contains a handful of very useful functions for parsing types from request queries and payloads.

#### Examples

* Several reference implementations utilizing `server` and `pubsub` are available in the [`examples`](https://github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/tree/master/examples) subdirectory.
* There are also examples within the GoDoc: [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/examples)
